# Leveraging BigQuery to Analyze Solar Potential Across the US

# Overview:

This project utilizes Google BigQuery's bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code dataset to analyze solar potential across the United States. 

By leveraging SQL queries and data visualization techniques, we aim to identify regions with optimal solar energy potential.

# Data Source:

**BigQuery Public Dataset:** bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code

# Data Analysis:


**Data Extraction:**

  Relevant data, including postal_code, average_solar_potential, total_area, and other pertinent fields, was extracted from the dataset.

  
# Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Data was cleaned to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Outliers and anomalies were identified and addressed.


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical summaries were calculated to understand data distribution.

Visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) were used to explore relationships between variables.

Correlation Analysis:

The correlation between average_solar_potential and total_area was calculated to assess the strength of the relationship.

****Key Findings:**

Strong Correlation: A strong positive correlation was found between average_solar_potential and total_area, indicating that larger areas tend to have higher solar potential.

Top Solar Potential States: New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada emerged as the top states with the highest average solar potential.

# Recommendations

Based on the findings of this analysis, the following recommendations can be considered:

**Targeted Solar Investments:** Prioritize solar energy investments in states with high solar potential, such as California, Arizona, and Nevada.

**Policy Incentives:** Implement supportive policies and incentives to encourage solar energy adoption, including tax credits, rebates, and net 

metering programs.

**Grid Integration:** Invest in grid infrastructure to accommodate increased solar energy generation and ensure grid stability.

**Community Solar Programs:** Promote community solar programs to enable broader participation in solar energy.

**Research and Development:** Continue to invest in research and development to improve solar cell efficiency and reduce costs.  


# Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the solar potential across the United States.

By identifying regions with high solar potential, policymakers, energy companies, and individuals

can make informed decisions about solar energy investments and adoption. Further analysis,

such as incorporating factors like climate, terrain, and policy incentives, can provide even more granular insights.
